# Instacart-Basket-Analysis
 # This Repository contains all Python exercises and Achievements as part of my Data Analysis-Python learning course with Career Foundry.
 ## The data sets used for practicing is Instacart Basket online grocery store open source data.
 Orders, Products, Departments, Customers( this data set is dummy set created by Career Foundry)
 
 ## Data Profiling and Cleaning
Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager. Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os,
 matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).
 
 ● Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking
 the top and the bottom of the dataframe.
 ● Wheneveradataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its shape and basic statistics.
 ● Allproject data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge flag shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.
 ● Mergeddataset only contains variables to be used in the analysis.
 ● All column names are self-explanatory.
 ● All identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.
 ● Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have been checked and addressed.
 ● Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created.
 ● All sub samples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a consistent naming convention.
 ● Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.
 ● At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.
 ● Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to customer information.

 ## Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the questions in the project brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
 ## Final report contains data citation for Instacart and customer data sets. https://1drv.ms/x/c/0fdf032c13c923fa/IQCOfO9d4oMaRItw0-HKGpl5ASxPD2VsA8Q2W_5PjyAXOtw?e=cC6fsE
